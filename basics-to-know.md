Pixel RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)

What is neural networks?
-	Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. Neural networks help us cluster and classify.

What is LSTM?
-	Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems.
-	LSTMs are a complex area of deep learning.

What is RNN?
-	Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) are a type of Neural Network where the output from previous step are fed as input to the current step.
